/**
 * The Karnaugh map, also known as the K-map, is a method to simplify boolean algebra expressions. 
 * The required boolean results are transferred from a truth table onto a two-dimensional grid where the cells are ordered in Gray code,
 * and each cell position represents one combination of input conditions, while each cell value represents the corresponding output value.
 * Optimal groups of 1s or 0s are identified, which represent the terms of a canonical form of the logic in the original truth table. 
 * These terms can be used to write a minimal boolean expression representing the required logic.
